title: How to Configure FCL
---

# Configuration

FCL has a mechanism that lets you configure various aspects of FCL. The main idea is that you can move from one instance of the 
Flow Blockchain to another, for example, the `Local Emulator`, `Testnet`, or `Mainnet`. So the only thing you need to change is your configuration.

## Setting Configuration Values

First, you need to call the `put` method on the `config` instance to set a configuration value because the put method will return the `config` instance so it can be chained.
We recommend doing this once and as early in the life cycle.

> Values only need to be set once.

## Example 1
Local emulator configuration

```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl
	 .config({
        "app.detail.title": "Test App",
        "app.detail.icon": "https://placekitten.com/g/200/200",
      })
	 .put("debug.accounts", true)
	 .put("logger.level", 2)
	 .put("flow.network", "local")
	 .put("accessNode.api", "http://localhost:8888")
	 .put("discovery.wallet", "http://localhost:8701/fcl/authn")
```

## Example 2
Testnet configuration

```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl
	 .config({
        "app.detail.title": "Test App",
        "app.detail.icon": "https://placekitten.com/g/200/200",
      })
	 .put("logger.level", 2)
	 .put("flow.network", "testnet")
	 .put("accessNode.api", "https://rest-testnet.onflow.org")
   .put("discovery.wallet","https://fcldiscovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn")
```

## Example 3
Mainnet configuration

```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl
      .config({
        "app.detail.title": "Test App",
        "app.detail.icon": "https://placekitten.com/g/200/200",
      })
      .put("flow.network", "mainnet")
	    .put("accessNode.api", "https://rest-mainnet.onflow.org")
	    .put("discovery.wallet", "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/authn")
```

## Getting Configuration Values

The `config` instance has an asynchronous `get` method which you can pass as a 
fallback value in case the configuration state does not include what you want.
```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl.config()
  .put("foo", "bar")
  .put("woot", 5)
  .put("rawr", 7)

const FALLBACK = 1

async function addStuff () {
  var woot = await fcl.config().get("woot", FALLBACK) // will be 5 -- set in the config before
  var rawr = await fcl.config().get("rawr", FALLBACK) // will be 7 -- set in the config before
  var hmmm = await fcl.config().get("hmmm", FALLBACK) // will be 1 -- uses fallback because this isnt in the config

  return woot + rawr + hmmm
}

addStuff().then(d => console.log(d)) // 13 (5 + 7 + 1)
```

## Address replacement in scripts and transactions

Configuration keys that start with `0x` are replaced in FCL scripts and transactions, and this allows you to write your script or transaction Cadence code once and not have to change it when you point your application at a different instance of the Flow Blockchain.

```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl.config()
  .put("0xFungibleToken", "0xf233dcee88fe0abe")

async function myScript () {
  return fcl.send([
    fcl.script`
      import FungibleToken from 0xFungibleToken // will be replaced with 0xf233dcee88fe0abe because of the configuration

      pub fun main() { /* Rest of the script goes here */ }
    `
  ]).then(fcl.decode)
}

async function myTransaction () {
  return fcl.send([
    fcl.transaction`
      import FungibleToken from 0xFungibleToken // will be replaced with 0xf233dcee88fe0abe because of the configuration

      transaction { /* Rest of the transaction goes here */ }
    `
  ]).then(fcl.decode)
}
```

## Example

```javascript
import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"

fcl.config()
  .put("flow.network", "testnet")
  .put("accessNode.api", "https://rest-testnet.onflow.org")
  .put("discovery.wallet", "http://localhost:3000/fcl/authn")
  .put("app.detail.title", "Test Harness")
  .put("app.detail.icon", "https://i.imgur.com/r23Zhvu.png")
  .put("service.OpenID.scopes", "email email_verified name zoneinfo")
  .put("0xFlowToken", "0x7e60df042a9c0868")
```
